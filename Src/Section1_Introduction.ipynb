        "In this tutorial I will teach you guys python from a beginners perspective. If you guys want to know about Python and study the theory behind it then read the [documentation](https://www.python.org/). There is no point of me explaining the definition and giving introduction about Python. All you need to know given the problem what approach you should take in order to solve the problem.\n",

        "The introduction section contains only the installation procedures of python and its IDE, but I strongly recommend you guys to just use Notebooks instead. Yes you heard it right be a professional coder and start working in notebooks. Here throughout the tutorial I'll be using the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) notebook to type all my code, it's a really good notebook to type the code and so that I can focus on documentation. If you use Google Colab you don't have to install nothing no Python, no IDE and no external libraries etc. Let's start coding. "
