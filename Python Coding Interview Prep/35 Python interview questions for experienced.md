## 1. Debugging a Python Program

```python
# By using this command we can debug a python program
python -m pdb python-script.py
```

---

## 2. Yield Keyword in Python
### The keyword in Python can turn any function into a generator. Yields work like a standard return keyword.

```python
def days(index):
    day = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St']            
    yield day[index]    
    yield day[index+1]  
  
res = days(0)
print(next(res), next(res))

> S M
```

## 3. Converting a List into a String
### When we want to convert a list into a string, we can use the `<.join()>` method which joins all the elements into one and returns as a string.

```python
days = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St'] 
ltos = ' '.join(days)
print(ltos)

> S M T W Tr F St
```

## 4. Converting a List into a Tuple
### By using Python `<tuple()>` function we can convert a list into a tuple. But we canâ€™t change the list after turning it into tuple, because it becomes immutable.

```python
days = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St'] 
ltos = tuple(days)
print(ltos)

> ('S', 'M', 'T', 'W', 'Tr', 'F', 'St')
```
---


## 5. Converting a List into a Set
### User can convert list into set by using `<set()>` function.

```python
days = ['S','M','T','W','Tr','F','St'] 
ltos = set(days)
print(ltos)

> {'T', 'W', 'M', 'F', 'S', 'Tr', 'St'}
```
---

## 6. Counting the occurrences of a particular element in the list
### We can count the occurrences of an individual element by using a `<count()>` function.

```python
days = ['S','M','W', 'M','M','F','S']

print(days.count('M'))

> 3
```
---

### 6.1. Counting the occurrences of elements in the list

```python
days = ['S','M','M','M','F','S']
y = set(days)

print([[x,days.count(x)] for x in y])

> [['M', 3], ['S', 2], ['F', 1]]
```

---

## 7. Creating a NumPy Array in Python
### NumPy arrays are more flexible then lists in Python.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)
print(type(arr))

> [1 2 3 4 5]
  <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
  
  ```
