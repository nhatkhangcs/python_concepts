# 15 Python Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. Discuss some characteristics of the Python programming language.

> Python is object-oriented, it's easy to read, and makes complex tasks simple. It's a Rapid Application Development (RAD) program, and I often use it as a scripting language. It's an interpreted language, dramatically typed, and its functions are first-class objects. You can use any text editor to write Python.  Python uses third-party modules, is compatible with all major operating systems, and dynamically uses variables. Other reasons it's popular are its outstanding library, it's ability to support big data, and that it can expedite test-driven development.


### 2. What are some of Python's core default modules?

> Default modules include email, which is parsed and generated by Python. Other default modules are XML support, string, and databases.

### 3. Discuss the frameworks for app development that are popular with Python users.

> Python is an excellent general-purpose dynamic language because it's easy to understand and implement. It's popular for creating various apps for mobile phones because of its interactive environment. It runs on the major operating systems, and there are many frameworks for using Python. For instance, Pyramid, Circuits, and CherryPy as well as other frameworks are Flask, Web2Py, Pycnic and Django.


### 4. How does Python manage memory?

> Python manages memory with private heap space. The private heap holds Python objects and data structures. The memory manager assigns objects. The garbage collector recycles any unused memory and routes it to the heap space.
